SUBJECT OF THIS SOURCE CODE LICENSE AGREEMENT ("Agreement") is that Vidispine AB, Sweden (“Vidispine”) hereby grants to an active customer on VidiNet a license to reproduce, store, make modifications, and distribute the Work in Object (non-source) form.

0. NON-LEGALESE SUMMARY – this section is not part of the Agreement 
The Vidispine Development Toolkit is provided by Vidispine to simplify your application develop-ment. You have access to and have the right to use the code in the Vidispine Development Toolkit as long as you are an active customer of Vidinet services, e.g., by running a VidiCore API instance in VidiNet, or using VidiNet Apps or Services for at least USD 50 per month. 
As part of the agreement you are allowed to develop and market applications based on the code, as well as make changes to the code if needed to build your application. If you want to make the changes a permanent part of the Vidispine Development Toolkit we will ask you to transfer the Intellectual Property of that code to Vidispine.
